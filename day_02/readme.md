# 🐍 Day 2 - Conditional Statements & Decision Making

Welcome to **Day 2** of my Python learning journey!  
In this folder, I’ve practiced **if, elif, and else statements**, learned how Python makes decisions, and how to handle multiple conditions together.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered
1. **Basic Print Statements**
   - How to display text using the `print()` function.
2. **Variables & Data Types**
   - `int`, `bool`, `NoneType`
   - Using the `type()` function to check data types.
3. **Arithmetic Operators**
   - Addition `+`, Subtraction `-`, Multiplication `*`, Division `/`, Exponent `**`, Modulus `%`
4. **Relational (Comparison) Operators**
   - `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
5. **Assignment Operators**
   - `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `**=`
6. **Logical Operators**
   - `and`, `or`, `not`
7. **Type Casting**
   - Converting string to float/int using `float()` and `int()`
8. **Taking User Input**
   - Using `input()` and formatted output with **f-strings**
=======
1. **If Statement**
   - Basic syntax and indentation importance.
   - Executing code when a condition is `True`.

2. **If-Else Statement**
   - Providing an alternative block when condition is `False`.

3. **Elif Ladder**
   - Checking multiple conditions one after another.

4. **Nested If**
   - Placing one `if` statement inside another.

5. **Logical Operators with Conditions**
   - Using `and`, `or`, and `not` inside decision-making.

6. **Comparison with User Input**
   - Taking user input and comparing it using relational operators.

7. **Practical Examples**
   - Even/Odd number checker  
   - Positive/Negative/Zero number classification  
   - Grading system  
   - Voting eligibility check  
   - Largest of three numbers

## 💻 Example Output
Hello, world
I am Sohail
I am a Python programmer
Type of age: <class 'int'>
Type of old: <class 'bool'>
Type of year: <class 'NoneType'>
a + b = 7
a - b = 3
a * b = 10
...
Your name is Sohail, your age is 18, and your marks are 95.
