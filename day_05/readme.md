# 📘 Python Beginner Project – Day 5

## 📝 Topics Covered
Day 5 focuses on **loops in Python** (while loops and for loops) and the **range function**, which are essential for repeating tasks efficiently.

---

## 1️⃣ While Loops
- **Definition:** Executes a block of code **as long as a condition is True**.  
- **Use Cases:**
  - Printing a statement multiple times (e.g., a name 5 times).  
  - Printing numbers in descending or ascending order (e.g., 5 to 1).  
- **Key Points:**
  - Must update the loop variable to avoid **infinite loops**.  
  - Can use `break` to exit early if a condition is met.  

---

## 2️⃣ For Loops
- **Definition:** Iterates over a **sequence** like a list, string, or range.  
- **Use Cases:**
  - Looping through a **list of items** (like names).  
  - Iterating through **characters in a string**.  
- **Key Points:**
  - `for` loops are **sequence-based**, ideal when the number of iterations is known.  
  - Can be combined with the **range function** to generate numeric sequences.

## 3️⃣ Range Function
- **Definition:** Generates a sequence of numbers, commonly used with `for` loops.  
- **Forms:**
  1. `range(stop)` → 0 to stop-1  
  2. `range(start, stop)` → start to stop-1  
  3. `range(start, stop, step)` → start to stop-1 in increments of step  
- **Use Cases in Day 5:**
  - Printing numbers from 0–4, 2–9.  
  - Printing **even numbers** (step = 2) or **odd numbers** (step = 2 with start = 1).  

---

## 💡 Summary
- **While loops** are condition-based; good for **repetition when number of iterations is unknown**.  
- **For loops** are sequence-based; good for **lists, strings, or numeric ranges**.  
- **Range function** is used to generate sequences for iteration, including even and odd numbers.  
- Together, loops and ranges allow efficient handling of repetitive tasks in Python.
